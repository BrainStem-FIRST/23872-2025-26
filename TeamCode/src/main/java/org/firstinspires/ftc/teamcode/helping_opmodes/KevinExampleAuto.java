        // the robot starts at "start" and will drive to "end" and then drive back to "start"
        // why will it do this? because when I declare the "path" variable, I pass in TWO Waypoint objects
        // Whenever you declare a waypoint, you need to pass in the pose of the waypoint
        // the drivetrain will follow the waypoints in the order you declare them
        // if you want to create another drive path then just do:
        // DrivePath path2 = new DrivePath(robot.drive, etc pass in your waypoints here...)

        // for right now, there are 5 values you need to tune
        // 2 of them are located in PathParams (inside this file you will see a class called DefaultParams; its in this inner class)
        //   farHeadingKp: if you increase it, the robot will rotate faster but will oscillate more (vice versa)
        //   speedKp: if you increase it, the robot will drive faster but will oscillate more (and vice versa)
        // the other 3 values you need to tune are in Tolerance class
        //   xTol, yTol, and headingTol
        // the robot won't end the path until the position and heading errors are within these tolerances (so I suggest setting them to something like 3, 3, and Math.toRadians(5))

        // how do you know when you're done tuning? idk you decide, when the robot is not oscillating at each waypoint anymore
